IDEAS

- Write a script for checking if 2 pointers reference the same memory (pointers of different types)
- Make use of unique pointers

BUGS

- When giving pointer to huge allocation with offset from the beginning more than 1 chunk, the allocation will not be discovered
- Caches of large allocation bins contain allocations of smaller size, is small2index working correctly?
